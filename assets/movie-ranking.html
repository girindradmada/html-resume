<h2>Pulp Fiction</h2>
<p>Originally watched it because people hype it up a lot. But after watching it twice, it's honestly a very cool movie. The movie is very fragmented but still easy to follow and it's fun going back and trying to piece what section comes first and so on. Still don't know whats inside the briefcase though, maybe im too dumb. Still a good movie though.</p>

<h2>Breaking Bad</h2>
<p>Not a movie but a show, its super fun. Haven't finished season 5 but I still got less than a month to finish it before netflix takes it down so I think I'm gonna know what happens soon. Walt grows hair at the first episode of season 5.</p>

<h2>Gladiator 2</h2>
<p>Probably shouldn't be considered a top movie but I had a good time watching it with my girlfriend. There was pedro pascal.</p>

<h2>Honorable Mentions:</h2>
<p>
    1. Good Will Hunting <br>
    2. Rush Hour <br>
    3. Chicken Little
